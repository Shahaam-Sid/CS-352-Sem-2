Week 05 - Lab 05 Triangle Scenario
<br>
<p>First Draw UML.
Write a class Triangle with three instance double variables, namely sideA, sideB, and sideC. The class must have the following methods: 
A default constructor that creates a triangle with all sides being equal to 1.0.,
A one-parameter constructor that accepts a double and creates an equilateral triangle with all sides equal to the passed parameter.,
-A two-parameter constructor that accepts two doubles x and y, and creates an isosceles triangle with sides x, x, and y. 
-A three-parameter constructor that accepts three doubles x, y, and z, and creates a triangle with sides respectively equal to x, y, and z. 
-A constructor that accepts a reference to an existing triangle and creates a corresponding clone; it should also return a reference to the cloned triangle.</p>
<br>
<p>Make use of single constructor that do all the jobs demanded by multiple constructors and @property decorator for exposing and validating side values. This problem is designed to give you hands-on practice in object-oriented concepts such as constructor overloading, object cloning, static members, encapsulation, and basic geometric logic.</p>
